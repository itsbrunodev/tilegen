# üó∫Ô∏è tilegen

A fast, multi-threaded tool to slice large images into map‚Äëstyle tiles at multiple zoom levels.

## Features

- **Automatic zoom‚Äëlevel calculation**: Dynamically determines how deep to go based on image dimensions and a configurable magnification factor.
- **Worker‚Äëthread pool**: Fully utilizes all CPU cores via `worker_threads`.

## Installation

Before installing, make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsbrunodev/tilegen.git
cd tilegen
bun install
````

## Usage

tilegen can be used from the command line with the following options:

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-t, --tile-size <TILE_SIZE>` | The tile size of each image. | `256` |
| `-m, --max-mag <MAXIMUM_MAGNIFICATION>` | The maximum magnification factor. | `1` |
| `-i, --input <INPUT_PATH>` | The path to the input image. | `./input.png` |
| `-o, --output <OUTPUT_DIR>` | The path to the output directory where the tiles will be saved. | `./out/` |

### Example usage

```bash
bun start -t 512 -m 4 -i ./input.png -o ./out/
```

This will generate tiles at `./out/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`, with a tile size of `512` and a maximum magnification of `4` from the input image `./input.png`.

### What is maximum magnification?

`MAXIMUM_MAGNIFICATION` controls how deep your zoom levels go. It adjusts how many source‚Äëpixels each tile covers at the deepest level.

Increasing it by 1 gives you one extra zoom‚Äëin level (more detail at deepest zoom), at the cost of more tiles and storage.

For example, if `MAXIMUM_MAGNIFICATION` is `4`, at the deepest zoom level, each tile will cover 4x4 = 16 source pixels. If the input image is 1024x1024, this means there will be 4 zoom levels in total (`2^4 = 16`).
